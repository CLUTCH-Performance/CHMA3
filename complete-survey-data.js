These resources strengthen our operational capabilities and strategic positioning. Having a Voice: As a voting member, I appreciate having a meaningful role in shaping the direction and decisions of the hardscape sector. It reinforces a sense of inclusion and influence. What could be improved: Speed of Execution: One of the most critical areas for improvement is the pace at which initiatives are evaluated and implemented. At times, the process feels bureaucratic, more akin to a governmental body than an industry-leading organization. Example: Paver Methodology on OGA: For instance, companies have been installing pavers on OGA for over a decade. Yet, our formal stance and guidance on the methodology have only recently emerged. This delay illustrates the larger issue: if we aim to lead and represent the voice of the industry, our responsiveness must improve dramatically. Final Thought: If we truly want to maintain our position as the voice of the industry, we must move with greater urgency and agility. Our members rely on timely action, not just thoughtful deliberation. It may also help with social influencers who do not acknowledge our existence. ",

That advocacy is critical to maintaining standards and pushing the industry forward. Access to Expertise and Shared Knowledge: The knowledge base, guidance documents, and peer network help inform and validate our internal decisions. It’s a strong support system that keeps us aligned with best practices. Networking and Collaboration Opportunities: The ability to connect with other professionals across the industry has led to meaningful discussions, problem-solving, and shared innovation. Ways to Increase the Value: Faster Decision-Making and Action: The pace at which initiatives move through the organization is often too slow. As an example, the paver installation methodology on OGA has been practiced for over a decade, but the official position is just now catching up. We must improve our responsiveness to industry evolution. More Timely and Practical Guidance: As trends emerge, we need faster dissemination of guidelines or policy stances that reflect current practice rather than lag behind it.

Being part of shaping the industry narrative, not just observing it, is a core measure of success. Progress on High-Impact Initiatives: We would see traction on long-standing industry priorities, such as standardizing practices (like the OGA paver methodology), updating specifications, or tackling regulatory challenges. Success includes fewer things stuck in committee and more actions moving to completion. Clear ROI on Participation: Our time, dues, and participation yield value through access to resources, visibility into upcoming changes, and stronger positioning in the market. Ideally, we leave each year with tangible outcomes that improve how we operate or differentiate ourselves. Stronger Industry Alignment: We come away from a successful year feeling better aligned with peers, both in terms of relationships (the golf outing was great move towards doing this in a fun way) and shared understanding of standards and expectations. This alignment helps elevate the professionalism and reputation of the industry overall. Faster Feedback Loops: A good year would include more responsive, agile decision-making, with member input being gathered and acted on in weeks or months, not years."

Please be as specific as possible": "As an industry, we have a real opportunity to elevate both perception and performance by focusing more on installation best practices—not only through literature and tech specs, but by driving adoption at the contractor and homeowner level. Certified contractors are critical to long-term project success and industry growth. When homeowners understand the value of certification, they begin to demand it. This in turn creates a pull-through effect where contractors see the benefit of getting certified—not just as a badge, but as a market advantage. We need to strike the right balance: avoid alienating contractors with overly rigid regulation, but make certification meaningful and relevant enough that it becomes a differentiator. Ultimately, more certified contractors means more reliable installations, fewer premature failures, and a stronger reputation for hardscapes overall. On the contractor side, there must be clearer incentives. One model worth considering is the structure of the National Home Builders Association: a national umbrella with regional and state-level associations beneath it. If CMHA were to endorse or help organize local associations, we’d create more on-ramps for membership and engagement—especially if joining a local association provides a discount or benefit toward CMHA membership. Contractors want to be part of something larger—but they’re also busy. Most won’t travel to meetings unless there’s clear value. Offering real-world perks like discounts from vendor partners, access to exclusive training content, and promotional support for certified members can make CMHA membership more attractive and rewarding. Another important component is transparency and credibility. Increased testing—particularly around installation techniques, accessories, and sustainability—would help reinforce CMHA as a technical authority, not just an advocacy group. When we can show that we’re validating best practices and keeping pace with evolving techniques, contractors (and even third-party training providers) will be more inclined to align with our standards. This could open the door to affiliate programs where external online trainers teach to CMHA-endorsed methods, extending our reach and relevance. Internally, we also need to refocus committee participation. It’s frustrating when only a few voices engage during meetings while others remain passive. If members are appointed to committees, there should be clear expectations of contribution. A smaller, more active group is far more effective than a larger, disengaged one. Participation should be about progress, not just presence. There’s also an opportunity to re-evaluate how we position the annual meeting. Following the Precast Show may offer convenience, but it limits our ability to explore regional installation trends and local market strategies. Part of the value of in-person gatherings is gaining perspective from different geographies. By staggering our event away from the Precast Show, we can preserve that experience while still allowing members to attend both, if they choose. The pieces are all here. CMHA has the foundation, the structure, and the staff effort in place to fully realize the merger’s potential. We have the ability to improve training, elevate standards, increase member engagement, and grow the certified contractor base—ultimately selling more pavers and SRWs and building a stronger industry. But to capitalize on this momentum, we need to act decisively and quickly. If we move forward together with purpose, there’s no doubt we can bring this vision to life.",
            "What could CMHA provide to help you sell more products or services to the hardscape market? ": "We should prioritize additional testing and strategic lobbying to mandate the use of our products in updated building codes—particularly for stormwater mitigation. In parallel, we should work to develop a SRW plant certification program that meets DOT acceptance criteria, similar to the NPCA model. Additionally, from a hiring and training perspective, it would be beneficial to expand our onboarding resources—specifically tailored technical materials—for new sales representatives who may not have prior industry experience. This would accelerate their ramp-up and improve technical information being shared in the field.",

A collaborative approach is the only way to ensure fair, balanced, and effective standards. Too many producers and installers operating outside of established associations are promoting new techniques that which creates confusion and risk within the industry—especially as misinformation spreads quickly on social media. To protect the integrity and longevity of our work, we need a strong, unified association that not only sets the bar for best practices but also actively counters false narratives and educates the industry with facts, experience, and proven results.

With some different locations to entice more producers and contractors in the future, I think that will be beneficial for attendance and attracting more of CMHA's members. Beefing up the educational sessions' course descriptions at CMHA's annual meetings (move some to timeslots in the mornings before the Precast Show opens perhaps?) could help attract more registrations. Add 'This session is ideal for for: Contractors, site foremen, plant supervisors, technical sales representatives, etc...' Identifying specific titles or target audiences will help decision makers relate to how those courses can benefit their particular staff members, operations and leadership development opportunities.
